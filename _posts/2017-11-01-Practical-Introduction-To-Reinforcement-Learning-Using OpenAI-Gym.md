title: Practical Introduction to Reinforcement Learning Using OpenAI `gym`
---

Machine Learning enthusiasts might already have heard or known about Reinforcement Learning(RL). For those who don't, here is a brief introduction. Reinforcement Learning is the problem of getting an agent to act in the world so as to maximize its rewards. For example, consider a dog, we cannot directly tell the dog what it has to do but we can train the dog by giving it rewards(like food) if it does what is expected in the world and punish(do not give food) for not accomplishing the required task. Slowly the dog will figure out what it did to get the reward. Similarly, we can train a computer to do several tasks in this fashion, and it has been found that this technique can solve many problems which are difficult to solve in the traditional way very well. Few examples where RL is currently being applied - Playing Games like Chess, Go, video games, controlling robot manipulators, etc...
